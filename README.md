# HackJam : React hooks

### Getting Started

- Clone the repository

### Lauch the app

- `yarn` to install all the app dependencies.
  If you don't have yarn installed, install it via `npm i -g yarn` or you can use `npm install` instead.
- `yarn start` or `npm run start` to start the app. It will run on the port 3000.

### Exercise

- As you can see the app is running.
  It's a pretty simple app. You can order different pizzas, add new pizzas to your order, remove pizzas from it and you can check it out when you are ready.

#### Step 1: Hooks

  As you can see this app is written in classes, you should rewrite it using hooks instead.

#### Step 2: Typescript

  Typescript is better than Proptypes and that's a fact. Sadly this app was written without it and it would be super cool to add it for better reliability and for a better dev experience.

#### Step 3: Redux

  This app clearly lack some state management, try using Redux to fix this. Use it as you see fit, not everything need to go in the store ;)

#### Step 4: Build a backend

  For the moment the app still use some mock file. Buying mock pizzas is cool, but buying mock pizza using a backend is better. When everything else is done, try to implement a backend that works with the frontend you just rebuilt.
